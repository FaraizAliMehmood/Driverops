# 🚀 DriverOps SG - Feature Highlights

## Quick Reference Guide for Key Improvements

---

## 📊 1. Enhanced Flight Load Intelligence

### Before
```
SQ118 - Tokyo NRT
Terminal: T3
Capacity: 340 pax
Status: Landing
```

### After
```
SQ118 - Tokyo NRT
Terminal: T3
Expected: 312 / 340 pax
[92% Load] ← Color-coded badge (Green = High demand)
Status: Landing
```

**Key Benefit**: You now see the ACTUAL expected passenger count, not just aircraft capacity. A 92% load factor means ~312 potential customers versus just knowing it's a 340-seat plane.

---

## 🌧️ 2. Weather-Driven Surge Intelligence

### Before
```
Heavy rain predicted in 45 minutes around Changi area
Expect +40% surge pricing
```

### After
```
Heavy rain predicted in 45 minutes around Changi area

Regional Surge Predictions:
┌─────────────────────────┬──────────┐
│ Changi / East           │ +40% 📈  │ ← Heavy Rain
│ Central / CBD           │ +12% 📈  │ ← Light Rain  
│ North (Woodlands)       │ +8%  📈  │ ← Overcast
└─────────────────────────┴──────────┘
```

**Key Benefit**: Instead of generic surge info, you see EXACTLY which region will have the highest surge and why. Position yourself strategically!

## 📍 3. Smart Time-Based Zone Recommendations

### Dynamic Zones That Appear Automatically

#### Example: Evening Scenario (After 6 PM)

```
Zone Recommendations:

1. 🚂 Woodlands Train Station         [HIGH PRIORITY]
   Peak hour - Commuters from Malaysia
   ETA: 35 min | 1.6x multiplier
   [BEST CHOICE]

2. 🌙 Mandai Zoo / Night Safari       [MEDIUM]
   Night Safari closing time - High exit demand
   ETA: 30 min | 1.5x multiplier

3. ✈️ Changi Airport                   [HIGH]
   5 wide-body arrivals in 45min
   ETA: 15 min | 1.8x multiplier
   [BEST CHOICE]
```

#### Example: Morning Scenario (7-9 AM)

```
Zone Recommendations:

1. 🚂 Woodlands Train Station         [HIGH PRIORITY]
   Peak hour - Commuters from Malaysia

   [BEST CHOICE]

2. ✈️ Changi Airport                   [HIGH]
   Morning arrivals peak
   ETA: 15 min | 1.8x multiplier
   [BEST CHOICE]

(Night Safari does NOT appear - it's daytime)
```

**Key Benefit**: The system knows when Night Safari closes, when cross-border commuters peak, and only shows relevant zones. No manual filtering needed!

   - Green badges (90%+) = Best opportunities
   - Multiple green badges nearby = Position there

2. **Cross-Reference Weather & Flights**
   - Rain at Changi + High flight loads = Premium opportunity
   - Position 15-20 min before rain hits

3. **Time-Based Zones**
   - Morning (7-9 AM): Watch for Woodlands
   - Evening (6-8 PM): Watch for Woodlands + Night Safari
   - After 10 PM: Night Safari exit surge

4. **Use Manual Refresh**
   - Before deciding to drive to a zone

5. **Monitor "Updated X min ago"**
   - If > 5 min, data is refreshing soon
   - If > 10 min, hit manual refresh
